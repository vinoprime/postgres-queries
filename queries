# Ever make changes to pg_hba.conf and wish to apply your changes without restarting the Postgres server (impacting users)?  Easy!  Open a PSQL shell and execute the following query:
$ SELECT pg_reload_conf();

# to terminate ideal connections
$ SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'ac_finance'
AND pid <> pg_backend_pid()
AND state in ('idle');
